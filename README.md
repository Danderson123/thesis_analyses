# Thesis analyses

This repository houses the pipelines and scripts to reproduce the analyses from my PhD thesis. Each analysis has its own `README` that describes how the necessary tools can be installed, the data retrieved and the analyses re-run. Some involve downloading data and placing them in this top-level directory.
